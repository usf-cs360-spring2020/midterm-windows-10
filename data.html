        <!-- <p>Include some detailed information about the dataset here. You should <a href="#">add a link</a> to the original dataset. You might also want to quote the license:</p> -->

             <p> This project is supposed to visualize certain relationships between airline data from the San Francisco International Airport           </p>
              <p>Data acquired from <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/Transportation/Air-Traffic-Passenger-Statistics/rkru-6vcg">DataSF</a> on February 9, 2020.</p>

              <ol>
                        <li><strong>Activity Period:</strong> The year and month at which passenger activity took place. It's a numeric type with a range from 200507-201909.</li>

                        <li><strong>Operating Airline:</strong> Airline name for the operator of aircraft with passenger activity. It is a text type, with a range of Airline names.</li>

                        <li><strong>Operating Airline IATA Code:</strong>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) two-letter designation for the Operating Airline. It is a text type.</li>

                        <li><strong>Published Airline:</strong> Airline name that issues the ticket and books revenue for passenger activity. It is a text type</li>

                        <li><strong>Published Airline IATA Code:</strong> The International Air Transport association (IATA) two-letter designation for the Published Airline. It is a text type</li>

                        <li><strong>GEO Summary:</strong> Provides a more detailed breakdown of the GEO Summary field to designate the region in the world where activity in relation to SFO arrived from or departed to
              without stops. It is a text type.</li>

                        <li><strong>GEO Region:</strong>Provides a more detailed breakdown of the GEO Summary field to designate the region in the world where activity in relation to SFO arrived from or departed to
              without stops. It is a text type.</li>

                        <li><strong>Activity Type Code:</strong> A description of the physical actiona passenger took in relation to a flight, which includes boarding a flight (“enplanements”), getting off a flight (“deplanements”) and transiting to another location (“intransit”).  It is a text type.</li>

                        <li><strong>Price Category Code:</strong> A categorization of whether a Published Airline is a low-cost carrier or not a low-cost carrier. It is a text type. </li>

                        <li><strong>Terminal:</strong> The airport terminal designations at SFO where passenger activity took place.It is a text type.</li>

                      </ol>

        <p> For these specific visualizations, I ended up using</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Passenger Count </li>
        <li>Activity Period (Converted to Year)</li>
        <li>GEO Country (Registered Country) </li>
        <li>Boarding Area</li>
      </ol>


        <h3 id="wrangling">Wrangling</h3>
        <p> I originally downloaded the whole dataset since I wanted to work with more categories. </p>
        <p> The data had to be sorted and fitlered out and I ended up doing it based on the time periods, I filtereted out uncommon and unecessary data manually through tableu functions prior to importing into javscript. </p>
        <p> However, I did use the javascript sort function in order to reorder the data based on ascending and/or alphabetical order </p>
        <p> It was important to see the relevance and the importance of the data. </p>
